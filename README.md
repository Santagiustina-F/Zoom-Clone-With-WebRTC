# Dummy installation
This is repo is a fork starting from [this pull request](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Zoom-Clone-With-WebRTC/pull/32)  of  [Zoom-Clone-With-WebRTC](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Zoom-Clone-With-WebRTC). You can also find a video tutorial [here](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4&t=684s).  
My goal is to add E2E cryptography capability to this project by taking inspiration from [this example](https://webrtchacks.com/true-end-to-end-encryption-with-webrtc-insertable-streams/) whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/gh-pages/src/content/insertable-streams/endtoend-encryption).

Tested on windows 10.
## Dependencies
- Of course clone this repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Santagiustina-F/Zoom-Clone-With-WebRTC.git
  ```
- Install `nodejs` and `npm`  
  It's recommanded to use nodejs 10.x or higher. nodejs LTS(12.x) is selected here.  
  For windows user, please refer: [official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update

  # in case you don't have them
  sudo apt-get install curl

  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash - # this is for 64 bit machine
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```
- Packages of `nodejs`  
  It's recommanded that windows user run these commands as administrator to prevent some magic bugs.
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  npm i -g peer
  ```

## Certificate
If you want to use this application via IP address or domain name instead of `localhost`, this step is necessary. Since most of browsers block media(such as webcam) accessing from unsecure connections, we have to deploy this application with `HTTPS`. This repo comes with the key I generated. You can use it if you don't have `openssl` installed. Yet it's recommanded to generate your own key.  
Here are commands using `openssl` to generate a key and certificate:
> For windows user, `openssl` is a built-in command in MINGW64 git-bash.
> For Linux user, just run these commands in termial.
```bash
# install openssl if you don't have it
sudo apt-get install openssl
```

```bash
# generate a key
openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem

# this step will probably ask you to input the information of the signature,
# such as country, company name, etc
openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out csr.pem

# generate a certificate
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey server-key.pem -out server-cert.pem

# optional: we dont need this, but I think it's okay to keep it
rm csr.pem
```

## Run it
```On two different terminals run:
npm run devStart
# which launches the server responsible of setting-up the room
peerjs --port 3001
# which launches the server responsible of setting-up peer connections
```
And you can enter 
```
https://yourIP.addr:port/
```
in your borwser. It's likely to have a warning `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` or somthing like that. For Chrome, just click *Advance*, *Continue...*  
It will automatically generate a uuid and redirect you to your chatting room. For anyone want to join you, you can just share the url of your chatting room.
